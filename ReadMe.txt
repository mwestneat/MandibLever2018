MandibLever app version 4.0 for Mac OS

Using and Citing Mandiblever. MandibLever is free and open access. I can help you get started using it, and I am interested to see new results with it, and can help check for possible errors or bugs that might emerge with new data or applications. So feel free to send me preliminary results so I can double-check for errors in the program (or your data). More active participation on my part in running simulations and interpreting results may be enlisted if collaboration is arranged. If you use it I would appreciate it if you cite it using the following citations as appropriate:
